# NihiraBot â€“ A Simple Python AI Assistant

NihiraBot is a text-based personal assistant built using Python. It can respond to basic user queries like:
- What is the time?
- Tell me a joke
- Open Google
- Give me a Python tip

This project is beginner-friendly and inspired by intelligent agent systems. It will be extended over time to include more smart responses and voice capabilities.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Python (core)
- pyttsx3 (voice output)
- webbrowser/os modules
- Flask (to be added)
- Basic HTML frontend (optional)
